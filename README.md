<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Team Gym Connoisseurs

Team Members: Ho Kin Tat, Tan Si Rui

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

## About The Project

### Motivation

As fitness enthusiasts, we believe that tracking workouts is crucial for progressing towards our fitness goals. It helps us see our advancements in specific exercises and adjust our routines for optimal training. Logging workouts holds us accountable and honest, revealing our commitment and progress. It allows us to analyze our performance, track duration, intensity, and exercises performed. By tracking workouts, we become purpose-driven and more efficient, as it helps us plan, organize, and understand our fitness goals. It provides a clear measurement of our progress and motivates us to push harder. However, existing applications often lack the necessary functionalities or are inconvenient to integrate into our workouts. To address this, we aim to develop a convenient mobile application that allows users to easily log their fitness progress and work towards their health and fitness goals.


### Objectives

We aim to develop an all-encompassing mobile application that is able to track a large variety of different health-related information including workout details, weight, and calorie intake. By providing an avenue for one to track such information, we hope to optimize users’ workouts and lifestyles, helping them to achieve their fitness goals.


## User Stories

1. As an individual who exercises regularly, I would like to log my workouts as well as track my weight and calories using the same application

2. As an individual who wishes to improve on exercise forms, I would like a tutorial video on how to properly perform an exercise

3. As an individual who just started to work out, I want to know what workouts I can do with my current resources and how to execute the exercises in a safe manner as a beginner

4. As an individual with a fitness goal, I would like to be able to view charts and data from past workouts to make sure that I am progressing towards my goals.

5. As an individual who just started to gym, I have encountered machines in the gym that I am unsure of how to use. I would like to have guidance and learn how to properly use such machines.

6. As an individual, I would like to feel accomplished whenever I have completed every workout. I would also like to be able to view my friends’ progress in the gym.
